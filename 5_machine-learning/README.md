## My Courses

I have created courses and other content so that you can learn AWS Machine Learning.  Also I've included links to other top quality learning content here.  

- My **LinkedIn Learning course** `AWS ML Essentials` - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/amazon-web-services-machine-learning-essential-training)
- Main **AWS ML blog** at https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/
- Training from **AWS ML Team** at https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/mlu/ (NLP, Tabular Data or Computer Vision scenarios)
- To work with a large number of **AWS SageMaker Jupyter notebook** examples, create a Notebook and navigate to the `SageMaker Examples` tab your SageMaker notebook instance.  The URL will look something like this - https://demo.notebook.us-east-1.sagemaker.aws/tree#examples.  Shown below is a screenshot of example notebook categories available.
