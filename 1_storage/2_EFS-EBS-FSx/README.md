#### Amazon S3 (Simple Object Storage) and Glacier
- provides simple object storage and file archiving (the latter using the AWS Glacier service) using buckets w/unique names
- Use cases: hosting website images and videos, data analytics, and both mobile and web applications
- Object storage manages data as objects (data types are stored in their native formats)
- There is no hierarchy of relations between files with object storage â€” data objects can be distributed across several machines
- You can access the S3 service from anywhere on the internet depending on IAM permissions (can be public)

#### AWS EBS (Elastic Block Storage) 
- provides persistent block-level data storage as a volume mounted to one EC2 VM instance
- Use cases: business continuity, software testing, and database management
- EBS stores files in multiple volumes called blocks, which act as separate hard drives
- EBS devices are more flexible and offer higher performance than regular file storage

#### AWS EFS (Elastic File Storage)
- provides shared, elastic file storage system (grows/shrinks as you add/remove files) as a file system mounted to EC2 VM instances
